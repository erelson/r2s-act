Benchmark testing of alias table generation in Fortran
------------------------------------------------------

Run benchmark.sh to conduct this test.

``./benchmark.sh``

Other details:
-----------------

``benchmark.sh`` handles the running of the following scripts:

:grab_subroutine.py:  pulls all methods relating to alias table generation from the ``source.F90`` file that is passed to this script. Not very flexible (expects first relevant subroutine in ``source.F90`` to be gen_alias_table, and expects the last to be doSwap).
:mcnp_placeholder.F90: - includes mcnp_global for 'use' statements
:alias_table.F90: - autogenerated by grab_subroutine.py
:bench_alias_table.F90: - runs benchmark testing after importing contents of ``alias_table.F90``.
