Custom MCNP source routine information
======================================

The R2S-ACT workflow uses a custom photon sampling source routine in MCNP in order to sample particles on the mesh.

<<<<<<< HEAD
This folder contains a modified version(s) of the ``source.F90`` file, and a link to the custom-compiled DAG-MCNP executable that uses this custom ``source.F90`` file (link is only applicable for user in *cnergg* group on Wisconsin's CAE; see section *CNERG custom executables*).
=======
As of Oct. 30, 2012, the most up to date/capable *source.F90* replacement is ``source_gamma_refactor.F90``.
>>>>>>> WIP updates to source.F90 readme.

As of Nov. 27, 2012, the most up to date/capable ``source.F90`` replacement is ``source_gamma.F90``.

source.F90 files
----------------

The different ``source.F90`` versions...

Wisconsin R2S-ACT:

:``source_gamma.F90``: Derived from ``vendor/source_gamma_meshtal2.F90``; Implements alias table sampling of voxels, as well as alias table sampling of photon energies. Also implements biasing. Uses ``gammas`` file that can include bias values and custom energy bins.  The original code was modified from 24 energy groups to 42 groups (or custom), and dynamic array allocation was added.

From KIT (Germany); Details specified in ``vendor/Leichtle_R2Smesh_Source_20111006.pdf``:

:``vendor/source_gamma_meshtal1.F90``: uses RDUM and IDUM cards in MCNP
:``vendor/source_gamma_meshtal2.F90``: reads in data from file ``gammas`` 

From CCFE (UK):

Compiling
----------

<<<<<<< HEAD
In general, the user must copy or link the custom ``source.F90`` within the ``src`` directory for MCNP, and then build MCNP as usual.

General compiling tips

Compiling for CNERG users
==========================

On a CAE system, one should be able to use the mcnp5p links for running problems.

Alternately, to use one of these in a custom compile of MCNP/DAG-MCNP, one can check out the DAG-MCNP source, and then link the files in the repository to the ``DAG-MCNP/5.1.51/trunk/Source/src`` folder like this:

``ln -s *path to mcnp_source folder*/source_gamma.F90 source.F90``

(or you could copy the file to that folder, but it won't get updated when changes happen in the repository)

To *compile* DAG-MCNP:

We call the build scripts from within the /5.1.51/trunk/Source folder.
Since we are using some custom code, the .o files are in the way... use 'clean' (But this also gives an error so we build twice...); do the following two commands:

1:

<<<<<<< HEAD
``»» ../scripts/build_dagmc clean``

``«« error messages``

2:
=======
```
>> ../scripts/build_dagmc clean
<< error messages...
```

2:

``
>> ../scripts/build_dagmc
<< Success!
<<<<<<< HEAD
```
>>>>>>> WIP updates to source.F90 readme.

``»» ../scripts/build_dagmc``

``«« Success!``

You can now call the ``mcnp5`` executable that was created in ``Source/src``.

If you make further modifications to the same ``source.F90``, you can usually recompile directly with the second command above (clean is not needed).

You can make it easy to call my using an ``alias`` command in your ``.bashrc file``, e.g., for CNERG users:

``alias mcnp5p='$HOME/DAG-MCNP/5.1.51/trunk/Source/src/mcnp5'``

CNERG custom executables
---------------------------

For those in CNERG, a custom DAG-MCNP/MCNP5 executable compiled with the custom source routine is maintained.  You must be in the svn-dagmc group to access the modified executable. The executable is linked to as ``mcnp5p`` in ``r2s-act/mcnp_source``. The actual executable is managed/updated by Eric Relson (as of 11-10-2012).

testing/
---------

An ad-hoc testing framework using Python and bash scripting is located in the ``testing/`` directory.  Unit tests are written in Fortran.  The Python script extracts the necessary code from the custom ``source.F90``, and combines this code with some external parts of the MCNP code-base needed for testing (Specifically MCNP's random number generator, which is not export controlled, is reproduced in ``mcnp_placeholder.F90``).  Information on running the tests is given in ``testing/README.rst``.
